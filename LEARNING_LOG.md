# SDET Transition Learning Log

## Day 2: Control Flow (Date: Dec 16)
* **Concept:** Learned how to use `if/elif/else` for decision making and `break` to stop execution during critical failures (like a 500 Server Error).
* **Challenge:** (e.g., "I forgot to put the 'FizzBuzz' check at the top, so 15 was printing just 'Fizz'.")
* **Solution:** (e.g., "I moved the most specific condition (divisible by 3 and 5) to the very first `if` statement.")

## Day 3: DRY (Date: Dec 17)
* **Concept:** Learned how to use functions` for decision making and `break` to stop execution during critical failures (like a 500 Server Error).
* **Challenge:** (e.g., "I forgot to put the 'FizzBuzz' check at the top, so 15 was printing just 'Fizz'.")
* **Solution:** (e.g., "I moved the most specific condition (divisible by 3 and 5) to the very first `if` statement.")
